	<h3>Principles</h3> 
	<p>
		kmapper advocates short development cycles and follows the principles of <b>Feedback</b>, <b>Simplicity</b>, and <b>Change</b>. 
	</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4 principle">
			<h4>Feedback</h4>
			<p>
				Having contact with you in more frequent iterations, you get a clear insight into what is being developed. You can give feedback and steer the development as needed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Concise documentation of each iteration and written feedback avoids costly meetings. 
			</p> 
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 principle">
			<h4>Simplicity</h4>
				<p>
					Starting with the simplest solution, a system tackles current instead of future needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					With many little steps made, you have more control over the development process and the system being developed.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 principle">
			<h4>Change</h4>
			<p>
				As a problem is better understood, your requirements might change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Changes are embraced and new requirements are planned for the next iteration.
